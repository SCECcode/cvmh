5/2009: tested on a larger number of points, seemed effective

These interpolation scripts are meant to be used in a pipe like this:

$ arch/x86_64/vx < 50mcloud.txt | awk -f ../../interpolate/mk8n.awk | arch/x86_64/vx | awk -f ../../interpolate/8lto1.awk | paste 50mcloud.txt - | awk -f ../../interpolate/1lidw8.awk > out.txt

The idea is to first use mk8n.awk to create a list of input points
which includes the 8 closet neighbours and then pipe this again into
vx to get all necessary data for the interpolation.

The 8lto1.awk script just exists to make it possible to use "paste" to
add the rock type information to each set of 8 neighbours. The script
just puts 8 consecutive lines (the 8 neighbours) onto 1 line. The
lines get pretty long but on linux this seemed not be a problem.

After adding the rock type it is then possible to use 1lidw8.awk to
use inverse distance weighting on each line all of which have the 8
neighbour velocities. The script has provisions to also interpolate vs
and rho if required.
