	* Improve portability (runs on macOS and Linux) by redoing
	configure.ac and Makefile.am files to make better use of
	autotools, including using libtool to build libraries. Software is
	configured, built, installed, and tested via "configure", "make",
	"make install", and "make check".

	* Use curl instead of Python to download model data files. Install
	data files directory to installation data directory. This also
	alleviates needing to include the model data files in the
	distribution tarball. The model data files are installed to
	"$prefix/share/cvmh/model/cvmh" (this facilitates installation as
	part of the UCVM software).

	* Update vx program to use a command line argument to specify
	location of model data files instead of hardwiring path to ".".

	* Update vx and vxlite unit tests to use system() instead of
	execl(). Output exact command to be run and do not remove input
	and output files (removed by 'make clean') to facilitate
	debugging.

	* Change name of gctpc library from "libgeo" to "libgctpc" to
	avoid potential conflicts with other software.

	* Consolidate "scripts" subdirectories.

	* Addition of revisions to the basement surface that include the
	  localization and displacements of faults in the Santa Maria Basin.
	  This affects the boundary between the sediment and basement 
	  velocity parameterizations.

	David Gill <davidgil@usc.edu>

	* tag: replaced about ten, seemingly random cells which were shallow in
	       the basin and had a water tag with sediment and GTL tags (GTL tags are
	       obsolete and can be considered equivalent to sediment tag).
	* vp63: replaced water velocity in retagged cells with average from
		surrounding cells
	* vs65: replaced all sediment tagged cells with values based on Vp using
		Brocher (2005). This resulted mostly in no change but fixed some cells
		(about 8) which were close to the southern edge and had no-data or
		negative values.

	* Moved code distribution to use GNU build system
	* Minor bug fixes and enhancements to query code

2011-06-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Revised Moho, open Santa Maria basin to W, smooth transition at S 
	border of HR to LR model, San Bernardino basin, various former GTL 
	related cleanups.

2010-09-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu> and
	Patrick Small <patrices@usc.edu>

	* GTL removed.
	* Addition of C API for querying CVM-H
	* Addition of updated query command line tool vx_lite and horizontal 
	slice extractor vx_slice

2009-10-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Minor update of Moho surface in CM, corresponding update to changed 
	cells, truncated border by one cell in LR, fixed vp/vs in 
	interpolation area

2009-09-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Replaced LR and HR data files with Carl Tapes m16 model as 
	background, replaced Moho data with update, changed tagging.

2009-06-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Returned GTL cells in Salton Trough to original CVM-H values, higher 
	coord. output precision.

2009-03-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Changed density scaling to Nafe-Drake (Brocher, 2005)

2008-09-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Fixed vs in buffer zone, used model vp/vs, not interpolated vs,  in 
	core zone to be consistent with vp there.

2008-08-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Enlarged area to fit terashake box, added model vs in all voxets, no 
	tt file creation.

2008-01-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Replaced striped artefacts offshore San Diego with depth-basin 
	depth-seafloor calibrated model data.

2007-11-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Clarified geodetic datum with P. Suess.

2007-10-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>

	* Added vs voxet for lower crust/mantle, switched to Brocher (2005) vs 
	in LR/HR, truncated min. vp at 121m/s, made HR consistent with LR for 
	nodata points.

2007-09-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>
	* Updated lower crustal/mantle voxet to include Socal background vp.
	* Added lower crustal/mantle voxet, elevation voxets; updated 
	background tomographic model; updated README.

2007-06-01  Andreas Plesch <andreas_plesch@harvard.edu>
	* Modified to be consistent with direct query of voxet in gocad, 
	provide cell center, updated README.
